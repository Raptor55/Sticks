# Sticks
Sticks is a small puzzle game a couple friends of mine and I made at the May 2015 Codeday.
The preliminary version is console based, but we're planning to make an app version eventually.
The rules of the game are that on each player's turn, they can remove any number of sticks from a certain row.
The objective is to not remove the last stick. There are both single and multiplayer modes.
Disclaimer: Though sticks and stones are widely known to cause the breakage of bones, these sticks by themselves have been proven to not cause any significant damage to one's bones. Any injuries or casualties suffered while playing this game are not the responsibility of Fapsoft or its employees.
